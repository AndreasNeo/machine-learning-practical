* The implementation of the convolutional layer is in [mlp/layers.py](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_2/mlp/layers.py)
 in ConvolutionalLayer class. To test the correctness of the fprop, bprop and grads_wrt_params methods [notebooks/ConvolutionalLayer_tests.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_2/notebooks/ConvolutionalLayer_tests.ipynb) was provided.
 
 * The implementation of max pooling layer is in [mlp/layers.py](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_2/mlp/layers.py) 
 in MaxPooling2DLayer class. The tests are in [notebooks/MaxPoolingLayer_tests.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_2/notebooks/MaxPoolingLayer_tests.ipynb).
 
 * The findings of this coursework are outlined in the [report](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_2/report/coursework2.pdf).
