> * In the file [mlp/learning_rules.py](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/mlp/learning_rules.py) the following classes were implemented:
>> * RMSPropLearningRule
>> * AdamLearningRule
>> * AdamLearningRuleWithWeightDecay

> * Cosine annealing scheduler was implemented in [mlp/schedulers.py](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/mlp/schedulers.py) in CosineAnnealingWithWarmRestarts class.

> * The findings of this coursework are outlined in the [report](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/report/coursework1.pdf).
