In the file [mlp/learning_rules.py](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/mlp/learning_rules.py) the following classes were implemented:
* RMSPropLearningRule
* AdamLearningRule
* AdamLearningRuleWithWeightDecay. The test file is [notebooks/WeightDecay_tests.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/notebooks/WeightDecay_tests.ipynb).


Cosine annealing scheduler was implemented in [mlp/schedulers.py](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/mlp/schedulers.py) in CosineAnnealingWithWarmRestarts class. The test file for this class is [notebooks/CosineAnnealingScheduler_tests.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/notebooks/CosineAnnealingScheduler_tests.ipynb).

The experiments were carried out in the file [notebooks/Coursework_1.ipynb](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/notebooks/Coursework_1.ipynb) and the findings of this coursework are outlined in the [report](https://github.com/AndreasNeokleous/Machine-Learning-Practical/blob/master/coursework_1/report/coursework1.pdf).
