# Machine-Learning-Practical
My assignment solutions for [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/18-19/dpt/cxinfr11132.htm) course at University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk).

The base code for the course assignment can be found at https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/tree/mlp2018-9/coursework_1 and https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/tree/mlp2018-9/coursework_2 .

# Coursework 1 -  Exploration of RMSProp and Adam Learning Algorithms 
Implemented and explored:
* RMSProp and Adam.
* Learning rate scheduler for stochastic gradient decent (SGD) and Adam.
* Adam with regularization and weight decay.

# Coursework 2 - Classification of Handwritten Digits using Neural Networks 
* Implemented the gradients, forward and back propagation methods of a convolutional network.
* Implemented the max pooling layer.
* Explored the context in convolutional networks achieved with Pooling layers, Striding and Dilation.
