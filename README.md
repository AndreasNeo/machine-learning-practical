# Machine-Learning-Practical
My assignment solutions for [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/) course at University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk).

The base code for the course assignment and labs can be found at https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/tree/mlp2018-9/coursework_1 and https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/tree/mlp2018-9/coursework_2 .

# Coursework 1 -  Exploration of RMSProp and Adam Learning Algorithms 
> * Implemented and explored:
> > 1. RMSProp and Adam.
> > 2. Learning rate scheduler for stochastic gradient decent (SGD) and Adam.
> > 3. Adam with regularization and weight decay.

# Coursework 2 -  Project name Classification of Handwritten Digits using Neural Networks 
> * Implemented the gradients, forward and back propagation methods of a convolutional network.
> * Explored the context in convolutional networks achieved with Pooling layers, Striding and Dilation.
